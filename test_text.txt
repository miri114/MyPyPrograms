Five years passed before the chance he had been
seeking made its appearance. During all those years,
not one ray of hope, not one promise of attainment of
his desire had been held out to him. To everyone except
himself, he appeared only another cog in the Edison
business wheel, but in his own mind, he was the partner
of Edison every minute of the time, from the very day
that he first went to work there.
When he went to Orange, he did not say to himself,
I will try to induce Edison to give me a job of some
sort. He said, I will see Edison and put him on notice
that I have come to go into business with him.
He did not say.
